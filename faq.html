                                                Cancer screening involves tests used to look for signs that may suggest
                                                cancer,
                                                sometimes before symptoms develop. Some cancers may not cause noticeable
                                                symptoms in their early stages, and screening can help identify concerns
                                                earlier,
                                                allowing appropriate investigation or treatment where needed.<br><br>
                                                Screening does not diagnose cancer on its own and is not suitable or
                                                necessary for

                                                Early diagnosis of cancer is associated with better outcomes for many
                                                cancer types,
                                                and this is why national screening programmes exist. Screening can help
                                                identify
                                                cancers or areas of concern at an earlier stage, which may allow
                                                treatment to begin
                                                sooner.<br><br>
                                                However, screening does not guarantee improved outcomes for every
                                                individual and
                                                has recognised limitations.

                                                national
                                                programmes. Outside of this, individual cancer risk varies.<br><br>

                                                recommendations. This is best determined through clinical assessment.

                                                Yes. All screening tests have limitations.<br><br>
                                                False positive results can cause anxiety and may lead to further tests
                                                that ultimately
                                                show no cancer. False negative results can provide false reassurance.
                                                Some tests
                                                also carry procedural risks.<br><br>
                                                Careful selection of tests and consultant-led interpretation of results
                                                helps minimise
                                                unnecessary harm.
