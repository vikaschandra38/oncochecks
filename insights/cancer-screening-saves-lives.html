<h1>Screening Saves Lives.<span>
Advice from King Charles III
</span></h1>
</div>
    <img src="../assets/insights/king-charles-image.webp" alt="King Charles Photo" class="insight-thumbnail_img">
    <p>Our lifetime risk of cancer is now close to 1 in 2. That statistic is hard to ignore. Most of us know someone who has been affected by cancer, whether a family member, friend, or colleague. Cancer does not discriminate.It can affect anyone, regardless of age, background, or lifestyle.</p>
<p>As a consultant medical oncologist, I care for people with both early and advanced
cancers. One thing is consistently clear: cancers found at an early stage are far
easier to treat and have much higher cure rates. Early detection saves lives.</p>
<h2>What is cancer screening?</h2>
<p>Cancer screening involves tests designed to look for signs of cancer before
symptoms appear. This is important because many cancers cause no noticeable
symptoms in their early stages.</p>
<p>By detecting cancer earlier, screening may increase the chance of successful
treatment, reduce the need for intensive therapies, and improve long-term outcomes.
However, screening does not diagnose cancer on its own and is not appropriate for
everyone.</p>
<h2>Why early cancer detection matters</h2>
<p>If you need proof that screening makes a difference, listen to King Charles III. In a
recent message supporting Stand Up To Cancer, he highlighted that:</p>
<blockquote>“Early diagnosis quite simply saves lives.”</blockquote>
<p>He also reflected on his own experience:</p>
<blockquote>“I know from my own experience that a cancer diagnosis can feel overwhelming. Yet
I also know that early detection is the key that can transform treatment journeys,
giving invaluable time to medical teams and, to their patients, the precious gift of
hope.”</blockquote>
<p>For many people, cancer screening can feel confusing, frightening, or even
embarrassing. That is why it is so important to demystify the tests available and
understand what they involve.</p>
<h2>Who should have cancer screening?</h2>
<p>Screening recommendations vary depending on age, sex, lifestyle, medical history,
and family history of cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors.</p>
<p>In the UK, the NHS offers a national screening programme, and eligibility can be
checked using the official screening checker. This represents the minimum level of
screening recommended for the general population.</p>
<p>If you have additional risk factors, you may benefit from further or more targeted
tests. This is best discussed with a doctor who can guide you based on your
individual risk profile.</p>
<h2>Types of cancer screening tests</h2>
<h3>Blood-based tests</h3>
<p>Some cancers release proteins or genetic material into the bloodstream that can be
detected with blood tests. A common example is PSA testing for prostate cancer.</p>
<p>More recently, multi-cancer early detection (MCED) blood tests have been
developed. These tests aim to identify cancer signals by detecting circulating tumour
DNA or other cancer-related markers. Technologies vary, and this remains an
important and evolving area of cancer research.</p>
<h3>Imaging tests (scans)</h3>
<p>Imaging plays a key role in cancer detection. Different scans are used depending on
the organ being assessed, including ultrasound, X-ray, CT, and MRI.</p>
<p>Some imaging techniques use radiation, such as X-rays and CT scans. When used
repeatedly, radiation exposure can slightly increase cancer risk. For this reason,
choosing the right scan at the right time is important and should always involve a
discussion with a doctor about risks and benefits.</p>
<h3>Camera tests (endoscopy)</h3>
<p>Endoscopy allows doctors to look directly inside the body using a thin, flexible
camera. A common example is colonoscopy, which examines the large bowel.</p>
<p>Other endoscopic procedures can assess the stomach, oesophagus, bladder, or
womb. Although many people feel nervous about these tests, most tolerate them
well when properly prepared. Sedation is commonly used to ensure comfort.</p>
<p>Understanding what to expect beforehand can significantly reduce anxiety.</p>
<h3>Cervical screening (smear tests)</h3>
<p>Cervical screening checks the health of the cervix using a simple test that collects
cells with a soft brush. The sample is analysed for high-risk types of human
papillomavirus (HPV), which are responsible for over 99 percent of cervical cancers.</p>
<p>In England, cervical screening is offered to anyone with a cervix aged 25 to 64, with
recall intervals of three to five years depending on age.</p>
<p>Many people delay screening because it feels embarrassing or inconvenient, but
attending appointments can be life-saving.</p>
<h2>Are there any downsides to cancer screening?</h2>
<p>No screening test is perfect. False positive results can lead to anxiety and further
investigations that ultimately show no cancer. False negative results can also occur,
providing reassurance when cancer is not actually present.</p>
<p>This is why expert guidance is essential, both when choosing appropriate tests and
when interpreting results. Screening should complement, not replace, awareness of
your body and prompt medical review of new or persistent symptoms.</p>
<h2>A proactive approach to your health</h2>
<p>Your health is ultimately in your hands. As an oncologist, I strongly believe that
regular, appropriate cancer screening saves lives and improves outcomes when
used thoughtfully and in the right context.</p>
<p>Early-onset cancers are becoming more common. In clinical practice, I now care for
people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s with new cancer diagnoses. That reality is why
screening and prevention matter.</p>
<p>As King Charles III rightly said:</p>
<blockquote>“A few moments of minor inconvenience are a small price to pay for the reassurance
that comes for most people, or for some, the chance of early detection and life-
saving treatment.”</blockquote>
